# ocelot
Deputy has two revolvers, and so does Ocelot from Metal gear solid 3

I was thinking on making him commando first, but then I saw Deputy gameplay and changed my mind.

To be honest it's a low quality skin. Apparently the model it's a port from the PSP game. Still, for metal gear fans it should look *pretty good*

Another great character thanks to Bog. Your armatures are so clean so thank you lol.
